### Challenges Encountered
1. **Image Uploading**
One significant challenge was implementing the image uploading feature in the Android app. Initially, the goal was to allow users to upload profile pictures which would be saved and displayed within the app. Here are the key issues faced:

**Handling Image URIs:** The app needed to correctly handle image URIs from the deviceâ€™s storage.

**Saving Images Efficiently:** To manage user profile images effectively, it was necessary to save them in a way that persisted across app sessions.

**User Experience:** Ensuring a smooth user experience while uploading images was crucial. 

2. **Integrating the New Room Library**
Learning a New Library

Integrating the new Room library into the project was my first experience with this tool. This required a deep learning as I needed to understand the features and how to implement them effectively in the project.
